    Send files (images, videos, documents, audio) with messages by providing a URL in a media part.
    Pre-uploading via `POST /v3/attachments` is **optional** and only needed for specific optimization scenarios.

    ## Sending Media via URL (up to 10MB)

    Provide a publicly accessible HTTPS URL with a [supported media type](#supported-file-types) in the `url` field of a media part.

    ```json
    {
      "parts": [
        { "type": "media", "url": "https://your-cdn.com/images/photo.jpg" }
      ]
    }
    ```

    This works with any URL you already host — no pre-upload step required. **Maximum file size: 10MB.**

    ## Pre-Upload (required for files over 10MB)

    Use `POST /v3/attachments` when you want to:
    - **Send files larger than 10MB** (up to 100MB) — URL-based downloads are limited to 10MB
    - **Send the same file to many recipients** — upload once, reuse the `attachment_id` without re-downloading each time
    - **Reduce message send latency** — the file is already stored, so sending is faster

    **How it works:**
    1. `POST /v3/attachments` with file metadata → returns a presigned `upload_url` (valid for **15 minutes**) and a reusable `attachment_id`
    2. PUT the raw file bytes to the `upload_url` with the `required_headers` (no JSON or multipart — just the binary content)
    3. Reference the `attachment_id` in your media part when sending messages (stays valid unless deleted — see [Attachment Lifetime](#attachment-lifetime))

    **Key difference:** When you provide an external `url`, we download and process the file on every send.
    When you use a pre-uploaded `attachment_id`, the file is already stored — so repeated sends skip the download step entirely.

    ## Attachment Lifetime

    An `attachment_id` and its CDN URL stay valid until the file is deleted. Three things delete it:

    | Trigger | Applies to |
    |---|---|
    | `DELETE /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}` | Any attachment you own |
    | Ephemeral **attachments** tier (24–48h storage backstop) | Attachments on ephemeral-tier partners or phone numbers |
    | Ephemeral **messages** tier | Does **not** remove attachment bytes on its own: ephemeral-tier objects are removed by the 24–48h storage backstop above, and persistent-tier attachments are kept until you `DELETE` them explicitly. |

    Deletion is not reversible, and there is no `attachment.deleted` webhook. On either
    ephemeral tier, download anything you need to keep when you receive it rather than
    re-fetching later, and do not assume a pre-uploaded `attachment_id` can be reused
    indefinitely.

    ## Domain Allowlisting

    Attachment URLs in API responses are served from `cdn.linqapp.com`. This includes:
    - `url` fields in media and voice memo message parts
    - `download_url` fields in attachment and upload response objects

    If your application enforces domain allowlists (e.g., for SSRF protection), add:

    ```
    cdn.linqapp.com
    ```

    ## Supported File Types

    - **Images:** JPEG, PNG, GIF, HEIC, HEIF, TIFF, BMP
    - **Videos:** MP4, MOV, M4V
    - **Audio:** M4A, AAC, MP3, WAV, AIFF, CAF, AMR
    - **Documents:** PDF, TXT, RTF, CSV, Office formats, ZIP
    - **Contact & Calendar:** VCF, ICS

    ## Audio: Attachment vs Voice Memo

    Audio files sent as media parts appear as **downloadable file attachments** in iMessage.
    To send audio as an **iMessage voice memo bubble** (with native inline playback UI),
    use the dedicated `POST /v3/chats/{chatId}/voicememo` endpoint instead.

    ## File Size Limits

    - **URL-based (`url` field):** 10MB maximum
    - **Pre-upload (`attachment_id`):** 100MB maximum

    ## Security & Ownership

    Every attachment is bound to the partner account that created or received it. The API enforces ownership on every operation that touches an attachment — sending, retrieving, deleting.

    **What this means for you:**

    - An attachment created under your API key can only be referenced by your API key.
    - Submitting another partner's `attachment_id` returns `404 Not Found`. We do not disclose whether the id exists or belongs to someone else.
    - Submitting a CDN URL that resolves to another partner's attachment is rejected before the send is attempted.
    - Ownership enforcement applies uniformly across send, create-chat, voice memo, retrieve, and delete operations.

    Every attachment-affecting endpoint requires a valid partner API key. Unauthenticated calls return `401 Unauthorized`.

    ## Attachment URL Patterns

    Attachment URLs in API responses and webhook payloads use one of two layouts, depending on the attachment's tier:

    | Tier | URL pattern | TTL |
    |---|---|---|
    | Persistent (default) | `https://cdn.linqapp.com/attachments/partners/{partner_id}/{attachment_id}/{filename}` | Long-lived — the URL itself does not expire, but see [Attachment Lifetime](#attachment-lifetime) |
    | Ephemeral | Pre-signed URL pointing at the ephemeral prefix on `cdn.linqapp.com` | 15 minutes per signed URL — re-fetch via the API for a fresh URL |

    Inbound media you receive over webhooks uses the same layout your outbound sends produce, so the URL you store and the URL you build look identical — no special casing in your client.

    ## Ephemeral Attachments (Privacy Tier)

    For regulated or sensitive content, opt in to the **ephemeral attachments** tier by contacting your Linq support contact. You can request it at two scopes:

    | Scope | Effect |
    |---|---|
    | **Partner-wide** | Every outbound and inbound attachment on every phone number under your account is routed through the ephemeral tier. |
    | **Per phone number** | Only the specified phone numbers route their attachments through the ephemeral tier. The rest stay on the persistent tier. |

    **Behavioral differences vs the persistent default:**

    | Aspect | Persistent | Ephemeral |
    |---|---|---|
    | Download URL form | Long-lived CDN URL | Pre-signed URL with short TTL |
    | Retention floor | Until you call `DELETE` | **Hard backstop: 24–48h** — even without an explicit `DELETE`, the platform removes the underlying bytes within roughly 24–48 hours of upload |
    | URL re-fetch | Not required | Fetch via `GET /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}` for a fresh signed URL after TTL expiry |
    | Cross-partner isolation | Enforced | Enforced |

    **When to choose ephemeral:**

    - Your downstream system processes the file immediately on receipt and does not need to re-read it later.
    - You have a compliance requirement that the platform must not retain attachments beyond a short window.
    - The content is high-sensitivity (PHI, financial documents, identity verification) and you do not want it sitting behind a long-lived URL.

    **Important:** ephemeral applies in *both directions* — outbound files you upload **and** inbound media received by the phone numbers in that scope. Download bytes you need to keep promptly, or fetch a fresh signed URL via the API when needed.

    ## Deleting an Attachment

    To permanently remove an attachment you own, use:

    ```http
    DELETE /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}
    Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
    ```

    **What this does:**

    1. Verifies the attachment is owned by your account. Returns `404` otherwise.
    2. Removes the underlying file from Linq storage.
    3. Records an audit entry (timestamp, partner, attachment id).

    **Response codes:**

    | Status | Meaning |
    |---|---|
    | `204 No Content` | Deletion succeeded. The attachment is removed from Linq storage. |
    | `400 Bad Request` | `attachmentId` is not a valid UUID. |
    | `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key. |
    | `404 Not Found` | Attachment does not exist or is not owned by your account. |
    | `500 Internal Server Error` | Transient infrastructure issue — safe to retry. |

    **Effect on message history:**

    - Messages that referenced the deleted attachment remain visible.
    - The message part that pointed at the attachment is preserved with no attachment reference.
    - Webhook payloads previously delivered to you retain the original URL string, but downloads from that URL return `404` going forward.

    Deletion is **irreversible**. Once `204` is returned, the bytes are gone — there is no undelete.

    ## Inbound Media Flow

    When one of your phone numbers receives a message with media (image, video, audio, document), the platform:

    1. Stores the file under your partner account.
    2. Records metadata linked to the inbound message.
    3. Delivers a webhook whose `parts[]` array includes a `media` part with a `url` pointing at `cdn.linqapp.com`.
    4. If the receiving phone is opted in to ephemeral, the `url` is a short-TTL signed URL.

    You can acknowledge the webhook without fetching the file inline, and lazy-load via `GET /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}` later. For ephemeral attachments, retrieving via the API always returns a freshly-signed URL.

    ## Data Lifecycle Summary

    | Data | Persistent tier | Ephemeral tier |
    |---|---|---|
    | Attachment bytes | Retained until you `DELETE` | **Auto-removed within roughly 24–48 hours** of upload, independently of any message window. Also removable via `DELETE` |
    | Attachment metadata (id, filename, mime type, size) | Retained until you `DELETE` | Removed alongside the bytes |
    | Message body & parts | Retained per message-retention policy | Retained per message-retention policy — unless the line also has **ephemeral messages** enabled (see the Messages page), in which case the message's text, formatting, and attachment references are no longer retrievable through the API after that account's configured retention window (60 minutes – 24 hours, default 24 hours) from creation. Metadata is retained; see the Messages page for details |
    | Audit log of deletions | Retained per platform retention policy | Retained per platform retention policy |

    **In transit:** TLS 1.2+ everywhere. **At rest:** AES-256 (server-side encryption).

    ## Compliance Checklist

    If you're integrating Linq under a security or privacy review, here is the short list:

    - Allowlist exactly one outbound domain: `cdn.linqapp.com`.
    - Decide whether you need ephemeral attachments (high-sensitivity content) — request enablement through your Linq support contact.
    - Implement `DELETE /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}` calls in your deletion workflow.
    - Persist any attachments your application needs long-term — Linq is the authoritative source until you delete, but the ephemeral tier auto-purges within roughly 24–48 hours of upload.
    - For audit: every deletion is logged on Linq's side. Surface a confirmation in your application UI based on the `204` response.
    - For end-user "right to delete" requests: enumerate attachment ids and `DELETE` each. The platform does not provide a partner-wide wipe endpoint — deletion is per-attachment by design.

        """
        **This endpoint is optional.** You can send media by simply providing a URL in
        your message's media part — no pre-upload required. Use this endpoint only when
        you want to upload a file ahead of time for reuse or latency optimization.

        Returns a presigned upload URL and a reusable `attachment_id` you can reference
        in future messages. Attachments stored on the **ephemeral attachments tier**
        (and their URLs) are removed within roughly 24–48 hours of upload, independently
        of any message retention window. Attachments on the persistent tier are kept
        until you `DELETE` them, regardless of message expiry.

        ## Step 1: Request an upload URL

        Call `POST /v3/attachments` with file metadata:

        ```json
        {
          "filename": "photo.jpg",
          "content_type": "image/jpeg",
          "size_bytes": 1024000
        }
        ```

        The response includes an `upload_url` (valid for 15 minutes) and a reusable
        `attachment_id`.

        ## Step 2: Upload the file

        Make a PUT request to the `upload_url` with the raw file bytes as the request
        body. You **must** include all headers from `required_headers` exactly as
        returned — the presigned URL is signed with these values and S3 will reject the
        upload if they don't match.

        The request body is the binary file content — **not** JSON, **not** multipart
        form data. The file must equal `size_bytes` bytes (the value you declared in
        step 1).

        ```bash
        curl -X PUT "<upload_url from step 1>" \\
          -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \\
          -H "Content-Length: 1024000" \\
          --data-binary @photo.jpg
        ```

        ## Step 3: Send a message with the attachment

        Reference the `attachment_id` in a media part with `POST /v3/chats`. The ID
        stays valid for as many messages as you want — unless the attachment is stored
        on the ephemeral attachments tier, in which case it is removed within roughly
        24–48 hours of upload.

        ```json
        {
          "from": "+15559876543",
          "to": ["+15551234567"],
          "message": {
            "parts": [
              { "type": "media", "attachment_id": "<attachment_id from step 1>" }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ## When to use this instead of a URL in the media part

        - Sending the same file to multiple recipients (avoids re-downloading each time)
        - Large files where you want to separate upload from message send
        - Latency-sensitive sends where the file should already be stored

        If you just need to send a file once, skip all of this and pass a `url` directly
        in the media part instead.

    ## Sending Media via URL (up to 10MB)

    Provide a publicly accessible HTTPS URL with a [supported media type](#supported-file-types) in the `url` field of a media part.

    ```json

        { "type": "media", "url": "https://your-cdn.com/images/photo.jpg" }

    This works with any URL you already host — no pre-upload step required. **Maximum file size: 10MB.**

    ## Pre-Upload (required for files over 10MB)

    Use `POST /v3/attachments` when you want to:
    - **Send files larger than 10MB** (up to 100MB) — URL-based downloads are limited to 10MB
    - **Send the same file to many recipients** — upload once, reuse the `attachment_id` without re-downloading each time
    - **Reduce message send latency** — the file is already stored, so sending is faster

    **How it works:**
    1. `POST /v3/attachments` with file metadata → returns a presigned `upload_url` (valid for **15 minutes**) and a reusable `attachment_id`
    2. PUT the raw file bytes to the `upload_url` with the `required_headers` (no JSON or multipart — just the binary content)
    3. Reference the `attachment_id` in your media part when sending messages (stays valid unless deleted — see [Attachment Lifetime](#attachment-lifetime))

    **Key difference:** When you provide an external `url`, we download and process the file on every send.
    When you use a pre-uploaded `attachment_id`, the file is already stored — so repeated sends skip the download step entirely.

    ## Attachment Lifetime

    An `attachment_id` and its CDN URL stay valid until the file is deleted. Three things delete it:

    | Trigger | Applies to |
    |---|---|
    | `DELETE /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}` | Any attachment you own |
    | Ephemeral **attachments** tier (24–48h storage backstop) | Attachments on ephemeral-tier partners or phone numbers |
    | Ephemeral **messages** tier | Does **not** remove attachment bytes on its own: ephemeral-tier objects are removed by the 24–48h storage backstop above, and persistent-tier attachments are kept until you `DELETE` them explicitly. |

    Deletion is not reversible, and there is no `attachment.deleted` webhook. On either
    ephemeral tier, download anything you need to keep when you receive it rather than
    re-fetching later, and do not assume a pre-uploaded `attachment_id` can be reused
    indefinitely.

    ## Domain Allowlisting

    Attachment URLs in API responses are served from `cdn.linqapp.com`. This includes:
    - `url` fields in media and voice memo message parts
    - `download_url` fields in attachment and upload response objects

    If your application enforces domain allowlists (e.g., for SSRF protection), add:

    ```
    cdn.linqapp.com
    ```

    ## Supported File Types

    - **Images:** JPEG, PNG, GIF, HEIC, HEIF, TIFF, BMP
    - **Videos:** MP4, MOV, M4V
    - **Audio:** M4A, AAC, MP3, WAV, AIFF, CAF, AMR
    - **Documents:** PDF, TXT, RTF, CSV, Office formats, ZIP
    - **Contact & Calendar:** VCF, ICS

    ## Audio: Attachment vs Voice Memo

    Audio files sent as media parts appear as **downloadable file attachments** in iMessage.
    To send audio as an **iMessage voice memo bubble** (with native inline playback UI),
    use the dedicated `POST /v3/chats/{chatId}/voicememo` endpoint instead.

    ## File Size Limits

    - **URL-based (`url` field):** 10MB maximum
    - **Pre-upload (`attachment_id`):** 100MB maximum

    ## Security & Ownership

    Every attachment is bound to the partner account that created or received it. The API enforces ownership on every operation that touches an attachment — sending, retrieving, deleting.

    **What this means for you:**

    - An attachment created under your API key can only be referenced by your API key.
    - Submitting another partner's `attachment_id` returns `404 Not Found`. We do not disclose whether the id exists or belongs to someone else.
    - Submitting a CDN URL that resolves to another partner's attachment is rejected before the send is attempted.
    - Ownership enforcement applies uniformly across send, create-chat, voice memo, retrieve, and delete operations.

    Every attachment-affecting endpoint requires a valid partner API key. Unauthenticated calls return `401 Unauthorized`.

    ## Attachment URL Patterns

    Attachment URLs in API responses and webhook payloads use one of two layouts, depending on the attachment's tier:

    | Tier | URL pattern | TTL |
    |---|---|---|
    | Persistent (default) | `https://cdn.linqapp.com/attachments/partners/{partner_id}/{attachment_id}/{filename}` | Long-lived — the URL itself does not expire, but see [Attachment Lifetime](#attachment-lifetime) |
    | Ephemeral | Pre-signed URL pointing at the ephemeral prefix on `cdn.linqapp.com` | 15 minutes per signed URL — re-fetch via the API for a fresh URL |

    Inbound media you receive over webhooks uses the same layout your outbound sends produce, so the URL you store and the URL you build look identical — no special casing in your client.

    ## Ephemeral Attachments (Privacy Tier)

    For regulated or sensitive content, opt in to the **ephemeral attachments** tier by contacting your Linq support contact. You can request it at two scopes:

    | Scope | Effect |
    |---|---|
    | **Partner-wide** | Every outbound and inbound attachment on every phone number under your account is routed through the ephemeral tier. |
    | **Per phone number** | Only the specified phone numbers route their attachments through the ephemeral tier. The rest stay on the persistent tier. |

    **Behavioral differences vs the persistent default:**

    | Aspect | Persistent | Ephemeral |
    |---|---|---|
    | Download URL form | Long-lived CDN URL | Pre-signed URL with short TTL |
    | Retention floor | Until you call `DELETE` | **Hard backstop: 24–48h** — even without an explicit `DELETE`, the platform removes the underlying bytes within roughly 24–48 hours of upload |
    | URL re-fetch | Not required | Fetch via `GET /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}` for a fresh signed URL after TTL expiry |
    | Cross-partner isolation | Enforced | Enforced |

    **When to choose ephemeral:**

    - Your downstream system processes the file immediately on receipt and does not need to re-read it later.
    - You have a compliance requirement that the platform must not retain attachments beyond a short window.
    - The content is high-sensitivity (PHI, financial documents, identity verification) and you do not want it sitting behind a long-lived URL.

    **Important:** ephemeral applies in *both directions* — outbound files you upload **and** inbound media received by the phone numbers in that scope. Download bytes you need to keep promptly, or fetch a fresh signed URL via the API when needed.

    ## Deleting an Attachment

    To permanently remove an attachment you own, use:

    ```http
    DELETE /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}
    Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
    ```

    **What this does:**

    1. Verifies the attachment is owned by your account. Returns `404` otherwise.
    2. Removes the underlying file from Linq storage.
    3. Records an audit entry (timestamp, partner, attachment id).

    **Response codes:**

    | Status | Meaning |
    |---|---|
    | `204 No Content` | Deletion succeeded. The attachment is removed from Linq storage. |
    | `400 Bad Request` | `attachmentId` is not a valid UUID. |
    | `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key. |
    | `404 Not Found` | Attachment does not exist or is not owned by your account. |
    | `500 Internal Server Error` | Transient infrastructure issue — safe to retry. |

    **Effect on message history:**

    - Messages that referenced the deleted attachment remain visible.
    - The message part that pointed at the attachment is preserved with no attachment reference.
    - Webhook payloads previously delivered to you retain the original URL string, but downloads from that URL return `404` going forward.

    Deletion is **irreversible**. Once `204` is returned, the bytes are gone — there is no undelete.

    ## Inbound Media Flow

    When one of your phone numbers receives a message with media (image, video, audio, document), the platform:

    1. Stores the file under your partner account.
    2. Records metadata linked to the inbound message.
    3. Delivers a webhook whose `parts[]` array includes a `media` part with a `url` pointing at `cdn.linqapp.com`.
    4. If the receiving phone is opted in to ephemeral, the `url` is a short-TTL signed URL.

    You can acknowledge the webhook without fetching the file inline, and lazy-load via `GET /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}` later. For ephemeral attachments, retrieving via the API always returns a freshly-signed URL.

    ## Data Lifecycle Summary

    | Data | Persistent tier | Ephemeral tier |
    |---|---|---|
    | Attachment bytes | Retained until you `DELETE` | **Auto-removed within roughly 24–48 hours** of upload, independently of any message window. Also removable via `DELETE` |
    | Attachment metadata (id, filename, mime type, size) | Retained until you `DELETE` | Removed alongside the bytes |
    | Message body & parts | Retained per message-retention policy | Retained per message-retention policy — unless the line also has **ephemeral messages** enabled (see the Messages page), in which case the message's text, formatting, and attachment references are no longer retrievable through the API after that account's configured retention window (60 minutes – 24 hours, default 24 hours) from creation. Metadata is retained; see the Messages page for details |
    | Audit log of deletions | Retained per platform retention policy | Retained per platform retention policy |

    **In transit:** TLS 1.2+ everywhere. **At rest:** AES-256 (server-side encryption).

    ## Compliance Checklist

    If you're integrating Linq under a security or privacy review, here is the short list:

    - Allowlist exactly one outbound domain: `cdn.linqapp.com`.
    - Decide whether you need ephemeral attachments (high-sensitivity content) — request enablement through your Linq support contact.
    - Implement `DELETE /v3/attachments/{attachmentId}` calls in your deletion workflow.
    - Persist any attachments your application needs long-term — Linq is the authoritative source until you delete, but the ephemeral tier auto-purges within roughly 24–48 hours of upload.
    - For audit: every deletion is logged on Linq's side. Surface a confirmation in your application UI based on the `204` response.
    - For end-user "right to delete" requests: enumerate attachment ids and `DELETE` each. The platform does not provide a partner-wide wipe endpoint — deletion is per-attachment by design.

        """
        **This endpoint is optional.** You can send media by simply providing a URL in
        your message's media part — no pre-upload required. Use this endpoint only when
        you want to upload a file ahead of time for reuse or latency optimization.

        Returns a presigned upload URL and a reusable `attachment_id` you can reference
        in future messages. Attachments stored on the **ephemeral attachments tier**
        (and their URLs) are removed within roughly 24–48 hours of upload, independently
        of any message retention window. Attachments on the persistent tier are kept
        until you `DELETE` them, regardless of message expiry.

        ## Step 1: Request an upload URL

        Call `POST /v3/attachments` with file metadata:

        ```json
        {
          "filename": "photo.jpg",
          "content_type": "image/jpeg",
          "size_bytes": 1024000
        }
        ```

        The response includes an `upload_url` (valid for 15 minutes) and a reusable
        `attachment_id`.

        ## Step 2: Upload the file

        Make a PUT request to the `upload_url` with the raw file bytes as the request
        body. You **must** include all headers from `required_headers` exactly as
        returned — the presigned URL is signed with these values and S3 will reject the
        upload if they don't match.

        The request body is the binary file content — **not** JSON, **not** multipart
        form data. The file must equal `size_bytes` bytes (the value you declared in
        step 1).

        ```bash
        curl -X PUT "<upload_url from step 1>" \\
          -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \\
          -H "Content-Length: 1024000" \\
          --data-binary @photo.jpg
        ```

        ## Step 3: Send a message with the attachment

        Reference the `attachment_id` in a media part with `POST /v3/chats`. The ID
        stays valid for as many messages as you want — unless the attachment is stored
        on the ephemeral attachments tier, in which case it is removed within roughly
        24–48 hours of upload.

        ```json
        {
          "from": "+15559876543",
          "to": ["+15551234567"],
          "message": {
            "parts": [
              { "type": "media", "attachment_id": "<attachment_id from step 1>" }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ## When to use this instead of a URL in the media part

        - Sending the same file to multiple recipients (avoids re-downloading each time)
        - Large files where you want to separate upload from message send
        - Latency-sensitive sends where the file should already be stored

        If you just need to send a file once, skip all of this and pass a `url` directly
        in the media part instead.
